# HTML Intermediate

## List Elements

<ul>
    <li>Point in an unordered list </li>
    <li>By default, displayed as bullets 
    	<ol> 
        	<li>This, point, however? In an Ordered list </li>
        	<li>When some hierarchy is needed, defaults to numbered </li>
		<li>Use formatting too--Easier readability goes harder. 
    	</ol>
    </li>
</ul>

**Note:**

- In Markdown, you can nest ordered lists inside unordered lists for hierarchy.
- In HTML, `<ol>` (ordered list) and `<ul>` (unordered list) can be nested for structure and clarity.
- Use lists to organize info, show steps, or highlight key points!

## Nesting and Indent

- Stack lists inside others from a proper narration of your intention
- Indents tell you who's the boss of which list--a visual cue that helps navigate the code waters.

## Anchors

- Hyperlinks in HTML.
- `<a href="">Linked content </a>`
- Format in general: `<tag attribute=value>Content </tag>`
- Attributes give tags extra powers; some are common, some are tag-specific.


## Images 

- `<img src="url/size" alt="alternative text description (helps blind users and adds a descriptor in general) - Image"/>`
