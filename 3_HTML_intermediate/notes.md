## List Elements

<ul>
    <li>Point in an unordered list </li>
    <li>By default, displayed as bullets </li> 
    <ol> 
        <li>This, point, however? In an Ordered list </li>
        <li>When some hierarchy is needed, defaults to numbered </li>
	<li>Use formatting too--gotta show who's de boss
    </ol>
</ul>

**Note:**

- In Markdown, you can nest ordered lists inside unordered lists for hierarchy.
- In HTML, `<ol>` (ordered list) and `<ul>` (unordered list) can be nested for structure and clarity.
- Use lists to organize info, show steps, or highlight key points!
