<h3>Movie: Revenge of The Sith</h3>
<p>Well deserved Jed-ownfall, and one of the best, most head-turning monologues of all time. 
    <br /><em>
    "Do you know of the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. 
    <br /> Darth Plagueis was a dark lord of the Sith so powerful and so wise, he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create... life. 
    <br /> He had such a knowledge of the dark side that could even keep those he cared about, from dying. 
    <br /> The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
    <br /> He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did.
    <br /> Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew.
    <br /> Then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.
    <br /> Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."

<h3>Track: Mystika by Yulia Petrove</h3>
<p>Beautiful track that starts off with exactly what you'd think the mystical sounds like, goes on with beautiful beat transitions, and oh! that Saxophone interlude! Fantastic fucking track that I ain't ever getting out of my head.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Series: Better Call Saul</h3>
<p>The most perfect depiction of the persistence of reality and how it prolongs on and on and on tirelessly that the only thing that gets tired, is YOU. Of yourself. Of your surroundings, your loved ones, your choices... until you realize, having lost all of it, there are things that... you want, things you <em>do</em> have, and things you ain't gonna live without. </p>
<p>Sometimes its too late. Sometimes, not. Life continues to persist still, and will do so far beyond your own lifespan. </p>
<p>And that's okay.</p>
