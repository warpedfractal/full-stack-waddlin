# HTML

- Generally, Website = HTML + (CSS + JS).
  - While there can't be a website with *just* css or js, there CAN be with **HTML**.
  - HTML gives the content and structure— the *skeleton* of the web.
- **HyperText**: Text that links to other docs or pages. That’s where “hyperlinks” come from.
- **Markup Language**: Uses `<tags>` to mark up and organize text. Tags like `<p>`, `<h1>`, etc., tell browsers how to display stuff.
- **HTML Element**: `<opening_tag> Content </closing_tag>`

## Headings

- `<h1>Hello, World</h1>`
- Go from `<h1>` to `<h6>`, in descending order of hierarchical emphasis
- Ain't good practice to have more than one `<h1>`, buddy
- Don't skip headers. Hierarchy should go step by step

## Key Resources

- [mdnwebdocs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/Heading_Elements): All about `<h1>`–`<h6>`

## Paragraphs

- `<p> This is an HTML paragraph. </p>`
- Need to fill the space with all that bass? Say no more--[lipsum.com](lipsum.com), which maybe seasoned with [baconipsum.com](baconipsum.com) and [broipsum.com](broipsum.com) and more, arr matey!

## Void Elements

- They are self closing tags. They exist without tag partner. 
- `<hr />` or `<hr>` draws a horizontal line between two non-void elements
- `<br />` or `<br>` is when you want to press 'Enter' on the webpage
- By convention, use `<br />` elements from intra-paragraph activities ONLY. Just use the `<p></p>` elements to separate paragraphs, that what they're FOR!
