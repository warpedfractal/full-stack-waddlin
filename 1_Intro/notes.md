## How the Internet Works (Basics)

Think of the internet as a giant network where computers chat with each other and swap info.

**Here’s what happens when you visit a website:**

- You type a website address into your browser. Your computer, the **client** seeks that site.
- Your request first goes to your Internet Service Provider (**ISP**)—that’s your Airtel, Vodafone, or whoever gives you internet.
- Next stop: the **DNS server** (Domain Name System). This is like the internet’s phonebook. It takes the website name (like `www.example.com`) and looks up its real address (an IP address) to lead your computer in the right direction.
- Once the DNS finds the right address, your request is sent to the **server** (the computer that stores the website).
- The server sends the website’s data back to your computer, and boom—you see the site.

**Key words:** client, ISP, DNS, server, IP address.

***Key Lookups:***

- [nslookup.io](https://www.nslookup.io): Lets you find the IP address (server location) of any website you type in.
- [keybr.com](keybr.com): focus on typing speed.

## How a Website Works

Most websites are made up of three main files: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JS**.Why not just cram everything into one file? Because each has its own job:

- **HTML**: The content. Think of it as the bricks and structure of a house—text, images, buttons, links, all the raw stuff.
- **CSS**: The style. This is the paint, wallpaper, and layout—the colors, fonts, button shapes, and how things are arranged.
- **JS (JavaScript)**: The brains. This is what makes the house feel alive—lets you interact, click, search, and actually *do* things. Turns a boring static site into something you can play with.

**Example: Loading up Google**

- **HTML**: The "Google" logo, search bar, and buttons you see.
- **CSS**: How those things look and where they sit on the page.
- **JS**: Lets you type in "google in 1998" and the site actually changes to show you what Google looked like back then.

**Pro tip:**
Right-click on any website and hit "Inspect." You’ll see the code behind what’s on the page.
Try finding the code for the "Google Search" button—you can even change its label to something silly like "Lissajous Search."
It is only the local copy where the changes are registered; One reload and you cure the site of its drunkenness.

## Useful Tips: Code, Get the Most, Out this Course

- Understand that in each session the actual stuff that's being said. The code comes second to that, which, replicate after the said understanding. No use copying fast, there ain't no absorbing happening.
- Keep jotting stuff down.
- Your pace, you decide. No session skips, just blaze through 'em!
- The lectures may get tougher. So does life. Go back, listen to the lecture, bookmark and review it, come back and succeed. That's life! New things are where you put in time and effort.
- Stuck you will be, dearie hmm hahahaha. Imagine being a fully fledged dev, the PROfessional. Use the tools of a pro: Google, StackOverflow. You're often not the first person to happenstance upon the problem.
- Fixing your code and finally making it work: **PURE. EUPHORIA**.

## When Stuck

- Eval code *expectations* v reality. And what's the bridge to draw between.
- Exercise the Google+StackOverflow combination. Pro move.
- Revisit the session(s), materials.
- Ask Questions. On Udemy Q&A, and ppl that know.
- Google, Everything. All of it. A good friend, that one.
