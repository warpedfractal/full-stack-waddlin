<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
    Hi there, hello! I am Sriram. I'm a warpedfractal of ideas, perspectives and ways of life.
</p>

<p>
    Honestly, I resemble Machine Learning algorithms a lot--spotting patterns in the wild, analytically styling my thinking, making decisions based on what I already know, the subsequent experiences from having applied them, and informing my then and finally looping back to point one, refining and iterating myself through cyclical repetitions.
</p>

<p>
    As I continue to wrap my head around the warping fraction of life that I inhabit, I weave different threads to explore and expound upon this intricate tapestry of existence. Currently I'm doing so through Full Stack development, at the juncture of learning HTML, and how it underlies the web that's woven around our daily lives.
</p>

<p>
    Please enjoy your stay here, and feel free to reach out about whatever--we're all exploring the fractal world warping our lives on a consistent basis in different ways, and I for one truly enjoy such a unity in diversity.
