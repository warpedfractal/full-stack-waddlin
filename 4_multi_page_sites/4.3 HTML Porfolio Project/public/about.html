<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi there, hello! I'm Sriram – 
  <a href="https://github.com/warpedfractal" target="_blank" class="fractal-link">@WarpedFractal</a>, 
  a cosmic janitor sweeping up patterns between code and consciousness.
</p>
<!----Hidden debug log: 
  [USER] resembles hybrid of ML model + over-caffeinated bard. 
  Learning rate: ∞. Loss function: existential whimsy.

<p>
  I often feel like a machine learning algorithm left to self-supervise – 
  spotting latent patterns in chaos, backpropagating through lived experience, 
  optimizing for wonder over accuracy. My hyperparams?
  <ul>
    <li>Endless curiosity, </li>
    <li>Recursive self-reflection, and... </li>
    <li>A dash of chaos scaling. </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Currently concocting within the alchemy of Full Stack development--
  <ul>
    <li>Tracing HTML's threads in the world's <span class="web-weave">wide web</span></li>
    <li>Weaving a <abbr title="Intricate Progress">WIP</abbr> tapestry of bugs and breakthroughs.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Please enjoy your stay here, and feel free to reach out about anything you like--we're all exploring the fractal world warping our lives in different ways, and I for one truly enjoy such a unity in diversity.
