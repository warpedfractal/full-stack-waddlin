# HTML

- Generally, Website = HTML + (CSS + JS). 
    - While there can't be a website with *just* css or js, there CAN be with **HTML**.
    - HTML gives the content and structure— the *skeleton* of the web.
- **HyperText**: Text that links to other docs or pages. That’s where “hyperlinks” come from.
- **Markup Language**: Uses `<tags>` to mark up and organize text. Tags like `<p>`, `<h1>`, etc., tell browsers how to display stuff.
- **HTML Element**: `<opening_tag> Content </closing_tag>`

## Headings

- `<h1>Hello World!</h1>`
- Go from `<h1>` to `<h6>`, in descending order of hierarchical emphasis
- Ain't good practice to have more than one `<h1>`, buddy
- Don't skip headers. Hierarchy should go step by step
