# 🐤 Waddling the Way of the Full Stack

Waddling the way of the full stack, byte by byte.
Codes, notes, deets from the learning sessions.

## What’s This?

This repo is my personal playground and notebook as I stumble, trip, and (sometimes) sprint through the wild world of full stack web dev.
Code, notes, random thoughts, and maybe a few rants. And some 404s. For sure.

## What’s Inside?

- **Session notes:** Takeaways, “eureka!” moments, reminders to self.
- **Code samples:** Stuff I wrote, broke, and (hopefully) fixed.
- **Useful links:** Resources, tools, and whatever else helped me survive the wilderness of stack.

> Inspired by Dr. Angela Yu’s Full Stack course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/).

> No shortcuts, just waddling forward—byte by byte.
