# Waddling the Way of the Full Stack

Waddlin the way of the full stack, byte by byte.
Codes, notes, deets from the learning sessions. Here, take a seat. 💺

## What’s This?

This repo is my personal playground and notebook as I stumble, trip, and (sometimes) sprint through the wild world of full stack web dev.
Code, notes, random thoughts, maybe a few rants. Some 404s. For sure.

## What’s Inside?

- **Session notes:** Takeaways, “eureka!”s, reminders to self.
- **Code samples:** Stuff I wrote, broke, and (hopefully) fixed.
- **Useful links:** Resources, tools, and whatever else helped me survive the wilderness of stack.
