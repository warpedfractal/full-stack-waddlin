# Advanced CSS

## Display Types: inline, block, inline-block

HTML elements naturally follow default display behaviors ‚Äî but CSS lets us override them cleanly using the display property.

Instead of tweaking each element's quirks, understanding these three display types gives a shortcut to controlling layout and space behavior.

- üß© <span>
    - A semantic-less inline container.
    - Doesn't break line flow.
    - Often used for styling small parts of text.
    ```html
    <p>This is a <span>highlighted</span> word.</p>
    ```

### Inline
- Default for elements like <span>, <a>, <strong>.
- Flows within a line (like words in a sentence).
- Ignores width and height settings.
- Respects horizontal padding/margin, but not vertical.
- Cannot contain block elements.

üìå Takes up only as much width as its content.

### Block
- Default for elements like <div>, <p>, <h1>.
- Breaks onto a new line.
- Expands to fill 100% of parent‚Äôs width (unless width is set).
- Respects all padding, margin, width, and height.
- Can contain other blocks and inline elements.

üìå Great for layout containers or full-width sections.

### Inline-Block
- Behaves like inline on the outside (flows inline).
- Behaves like block on the inside (can set width, height, etc.).
- Respects all box model properties (padding, margin, borders).
- Doesn‚Äôt break the line but can stack horizontally with others.

üìå Useful for buttons, nav links, badges, etc.


## CSS Float

- Content wrapping made easy. 
- Think of float as telling elements:
‚ÄúHey, move aside and let others wrap around you.‚Äù    

    ```css
    img {
        float: left;
        /*Not directly a text but an IMAGE property instead. How text, and fellow images etc behave around the very presence of an image. */
    }
    ```
- We can't have elements that exist for a purpose have their lives wrapped around when an image or two comes across; then we use the **clear** property to steer *clear* of such instances.  
    ```css
    footer {
        clear: left;
    }

***Caveat:***

- Float isn‚Äôt layout-friendly for complex designs. Good for textwrap tho. 
- Use Flexbox/ Grid/ Bootstrap for predictable, flexible layouts.
- Float still pops up in legacy codebases, so worth knowing ‚Äî but avoid for layout whenever possible.

- Stay tuned for stuff like Flexbox, Bootstrap for complex layouts, for float may get confusing and cumbersome and may complicate with complexity!


## Responsive Web Design

- For compatibility for all screen shapes and sizes. 

### Media Query
- adding breakpoints, which, when satisfied, change to a diff css layout. 
- grids exist in css for the layouts purpose. 
    ```html
    <div class="grid-container">
        <div class="first-card"></div>
        <div class="card"></div>
        <div class="card"></div>
    </div>

    ```

    ```css
    .grid-container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; /*two columns of equal fractions */
        grid-template-rows: 100px 200px 300px;
        gap: 30px;
        }

        .first-card {
            grid-column: span 2;
        }

        .card {
            background-color: blue;
        }
    ```

### Flexbox
If  grid ‚âò 2D layout, 
    Flexbox ‚âò 1D layout. 
    
```html
<div class="flex-container">
    <div class="first-card"></div>
    <div class="card"></div>
    <div class="card"></div>

```
```css
.flex-container {
    display: flex;
}

.card {
    background: blue; 
    border: ;
    height: ;
    flex: 1;
}
```
